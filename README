SWP Compiler Construction
=========================

This is the repository for the Compiler Frontend (by hand) Team

Intro
-----

This is a Maven project, just import it to Eclipse.
Note: This guide is for the Eclipse IDE only currently.

Project setup
-------------

Setting up your JRE
* Important: We're using *Java 1.6* (lower versions won't work!)

Installing dependencies:
* Lombok:
  - Should be downloaded by Maven
  - Still needs to be installed to get Eclipse interopability
  - Locate the lombokXXX.jar in .m2/repository/org/projectlombok/lombok/0.11.0.
  - Install with 'sudo java -jar lombokXXX.jar' (do we really need root access here?)
